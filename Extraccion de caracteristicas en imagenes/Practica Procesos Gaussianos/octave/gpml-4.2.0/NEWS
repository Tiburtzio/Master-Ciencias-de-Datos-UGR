### NEW in version 4.0, 2016-09-29
A major code restructuring effort did take place in the current release unifying
certain inference functions and allowing more flexibility in covariance function
composition. We also redesigned the whole derivative computation pipeline to
strongly improve the overall runtime. We finally include grid-based covariance
approximations natively.

More generic sparse approximation using Power EP
 - unified treatment of FITC approximation, variational approaches VFE and hybrids
 - inducing input optimisation for all (compositions of) covariance functions dropping the previous limitation to a few standard examples
 - infFITC is now covered by the more generic infGaussLik function

Approximate covariance object unifying sparse approximations, grid-based approximations and exact covariance computations
 - implementation in cov/apx, cov/apxGrid, cov/apxSparse
 - generic infGaussLik unifies infExact,   infFITC         and infGrid
 - generic infLaplace  unifies infLaplace, infFITC_Laplace and infGrid_Laplace
 - generic infVB
 - enables efficient grid-based algebra for off-grid inputs, see reference j) above

Hiearchical structure of covariance functions
 - clear hierachical compositional implementation

    covDot  for dot-product-based covariances and
    covMaha for Mahalanobis-distance-based covariances

 - more flexibility as more variants are available and possible
 - all covariance functions offer derivatives w.r.t. inputs

Faster derivative computations for mean and cov functions
 - switched from partial derivatives to directional derivatives
 - simpler and more concise interface of mean and cov functions
 - much faster marginal likelihood derivative computations
 - simpler and more compact code

### NEW in version 3.0, 2010-07-23
A major code reorganisation effort did take place in the current release. First,
classification and regression are now done by a single file gp.m which is
completely generic in the likelihood. The previous regression program gpr.m
corresponds to gp.m with Gaussian likelihood. Several other likelihoods for
robust regresssion were added.
Further, the code now supports mean functions with a similar specification
mechanism as already used by the covariance functions. Previous implementations
correspond to using meanZero.m.
We merged the covariance functions covMatern3iso.m and covMatern5.iso into a
single covMaterniso.m and added a covariance function for additive functions as
well as the possibility to use only certain components of the data. Finally, we
included covPPiso.m a piecewise polynomial covariance function with compact
support.

New likelihood functions in lik/
 - likGauss.m, likLaplace.m, likLogistic.m and likT.m

New mean functions in mean/
 - meanConst.m, meanLinear.m, meanPow.m, meanProd.m, meanSum.m and meanZero.m

New covariance functions in cov/
 - covADD.m, covMask.m, covPPiso.m

The gprSRPP.m function which previously provided "Subset of Regressors" and the
"Projected Process" approximation has now been removed.


### NEW in version 2.1, 2007-07-25
covConst.m: fixed a bug which caused an error in the derivative of the log marginal
    likelihood for certain combinations of covariance functions and approximation
    methods. (Thanks to Antonio Eleuteri for reporting the problem)

gauher.m: added the function "gauher.m" which was mistakenly missing from the
    previous release. This caused an error for certain combinations of
    approximation method and likelihood function.

logistic.m: modified the approximation of moments calculation to use a mixture
    of cumulative Gaussian, rather than Gauss-Hermite quadrature, as the former
    turns out to be more accurate.


### NEW in version 2.0, 2007-06-25
Some code restructuring has taken place for the classification code to make it
more modular, to facilitate addition of new likelihood functions and
approximations methods. Now, all classification is done using the binaryGP
function, which (among other things) takes an approximation method and a
likelihood function as an arguments. Thus, binaryGP replaces both binaryEPGP
and binaryLapaceGP, although wrapper functions are still provided for backward
compatibility. This gives added flexibility: now EP can also be used wth the
logistic likelihood function (implemented using Gauss-Hermite quadrature).

approxEP.m: New file, containing the Expectation Propagation approximation
    method, which was previously contained in binaryEPGP.m

approxLA.m: New file, containing Laplaces approximation method, which was
    previously contained in binaryLaplace.m

approximations.m: New file, help for the approximation methods.

binaryEPGP.m: This file has been replaced by a wrapper (for backward
    compatibility) which calls the more general binaryGP function.

binaryGP.m: New general function to do binary classification.

binaryLaplaceGP.m: This file has been replaced by a wrapper (for backward
    compatibility) which calls the more general binaryGP function.

covMatern3iso.m, covMatern5iso.m, covNNone.m, covRQard.m, covRQiso.m,
cosSEard, covSEiso: now check more carefully, that persistent variables have
    the correct sizes, and some variable names have been modified.

cumGauss.m: New file, containing code for the cumulative Gaussian
    likelihood function

likelihoods.m: New file, help for likelihood functions

logistic.m: New file, logistic likelihood


### NEW in version 1.3, 2006-09-08
covRQard.m: bugfix: replaced x with x' and z with z' in line 36

covRQiso.m: bugfix: replaced x with x' and z with z' in line 28

minimize.m: correction: replaced "error()" with "error('')", and
            made a few cosmetic changes

binaryEPGP.m: added the line "lml = -n*log(2);" in line 77. This change
         should be largely inconsequential, but occationally may save things
         when the covariance matrix is exceptionally badly conditioned.


### NEW in version 1.2, 2006-05-10
added the "erfint" function to "binaryLaplaceGP.m". The erfint function
was missing by mistake, preventing the use of the "logistic" likelihood.


### NEW in version 1.1, 2006-04-12
added files: "covProd.m" and "covPeriodic.m"

changes: "covSEiso.m" was changed slightly to avoid the use of persistent
         variables

### NEW in version 1.0, 2006-03-29
initial version shipped with the book
